ANALYSIS:
MODEL = NOCOV; ! Sets all default covariances to zero
ESTIMATOR=MLR;
ITERATIONS=500000;
TYPE = COMPLEX;

MODEL:
! Create between components (random intercepts)
RIPTOTAL BY PMean_b@1 PMean_1@1 PMean_2@1;
RIE BY EB@1 E1@1 E2@1;


! Create within-person centered variables
WEB BY EB@1;
WE1 BY E1@1;
WE2 BY E2@1;

WPTOTALB BY PMean_b@1;
WPTOTAL1 BY PMean_1@1;
WPTOTAL2 BY PMean_2@1;

! Constrain the measurement error variances to zero
EB@0; E1@0; E2@0; 
PMean_b@0; PMean_1@0; PMean_2@0; 

! Estimate the lagged effects between the within-person 
! centered variables
WPTOTAL1 WE1 ON WPTOTALB WEB;
WPTOTAL2 WE2 ON WPTOTAL1 WE1;


! Estimate the covariance between the random intercepts
RIE WITH RIPTOTAL;

! Estimate the covariance between the within-person
! components at the first wave
WEB WITH WPTOTALB;

! Estimate the covariances between the residuals of
! the within-person components
